        "    *   **کولیب میں اپلوڈ کرنے کے لیے:** بائیں پینل میں 'Files' آئیکن پر کلک کریں (ایک فولڈر کی شکل کا آئیکن)۔ پھر 'Upload to session storage' آئیکن پر کلک کریں (ایک تیر کا نشان جو اوپر کی طرف اشارہ کر رہا ہے) اور اپنے کمپیوٹر سے ماڈل کی صحیح فائل منتخب کریں۔\n",
        "    *   **گوگل ڈرائیو سے استعمال کرنے کے لیے:** اگر فائل آپ کی گوگل ڈرائیو پر ہے، تو کولیب کو اپنی گوگل ڈرائیو سے منسلک کریں (بائیں پینل میں 'Files' آئیکن پر کلک کریں اور پھر 'Mount Google Drive' آئیکن پر کلک کریں)۔\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **تصدیق کریں کہ فائل اپلوڈ ہو گئی ہے:** ایک بار جب آپ کو یقین ہو جائے کہ آپ نے صحیح ماڈل فائل اپلوڈ کر دی ہے، تو براہ کرم اس مرحلے کے بعد ایک نیا `code_block` کمانڈ استعمال کرتے ہوئے دوبارہ `!ls -l /content/` چلا کر تصدیق کریں کہ آپ کی اپلوڈ کردہ ماڈل فائل اب ڈائریکٹوری میں نظر آ رہی ہے اور اس کا نام صحیح ہے۔\n",

        "جب تک صحیح ماڈل فائل اپلوڈ نہیں ہوتی، ہم اسے انزپ کرنے یا لوڈ کرنے کے اگلے مراحل پر نہیں بڑھ سکتے۔"

        "*   Multiple checks of the `/content/` directory using `!ls -l /content/` consistently revealed that only image files (e.g., `W_Shape_Sample.jpg`, `Pak_Dress.png`, `Denim Look Company Model.jpg`) and the default `sample_data` directory were present, rather than the expected Stable Diffusion model files (which typically have `.zip`, `.safetensors`, or `.ckpt` extensions) or an unzipped model folder.\n",
        "*   Despite detailed instructions provided by the agent on how to upload the correct model file and distinguishing between image and model file types, the essential model file was never successfully uploaded or identified.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "*   The user must first upload the actual Stable Diffusion model file (a `.zip`, `.safetensors`, or `.ckpt` file) to the Google Colab environment, ensuring it is a model file and not an image file.\n",
        "*   After uploading, the user should explicitly verify the presence and correct filename of the model file in the `/content/` directory using `!ls -l /content/` before proceeding with any unzipping or model loading steps.\n"
